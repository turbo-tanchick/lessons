        History
      </h3>
      <p>If in Britain, France and Belgium there are several breeds of sheepdogs - both long-haired, and hard-haired, and short-haired - the Germans bred only one breed from a large number of peasant sheepdogs.</p>
      <p>Even at the end of the 19th century, the German shepherd was considered a plebeian dog. Moreover, many lovers of imported English breeds believed that it was harmful to breed "wolf-type dogs" - but there was a person who created on their basis the best service dog in the world: Max von Stefanitz, who devoted his life to the creation and improvement of the German shepherd. He claimed that the German shepherd is primarily a working dog: the intelligence, beauty, and correct structure of the shepherd ensure its efficiency and devotion to the master.</p>
      <p>In addition to the proper shepherding service, Stefanitz sought to find other work for the German shepherd, one that would reveal all the possibilities of these dogs and make them useful for everyone. The German shepherd was adopted by the police and the army, which were looking for an alternative to expensive English breeds. German shepherds turned out to be first-class police and military dogs: during the First World War, they laid telephone cables, maintained communication, searched for the wounded, were used during patrols and guards. And after the army and the police, almost all countries of the world hired German shepherd dogs.</p>

        They have a good sense of smell and a brave character, these dogs are hardy, unpretentious and start working from a young age. German shepherds are intelligent and eager to cooperate with people. Many lovers are attracted to this breed not only as a working dog, but also as a companion dog.
      <p>
        German Shepherds are search and border dogs, sappers and customs officers, scouts and rescuers, guides for the blind and guards.

        There have always been German shepherds with slightly longer hair, long-haired. They have "scratches" behind the ears and on the back of the limbs, the fur is also slightly longer on the body. Such puppies are also born to standard German shepherds. In Europe, they are very popular as companion dogs, because they are very smart and beautiful.
      </p>
      <p>The German shepherd is a dog, as they say, "above average height", its height is 58 - 65 centimeters. However, there have always been fans who thought that a good dog should also be big. So they tried to breed very large shepherds - at least larger than 75 centimeters. Such large shepherds lost their mobility and endurance, and the German shepherd was "returned" to the standard more than once throughout its history. But in the Soviet Union, a new standard was developed (height up to 70 cm), and such large shepherds began to be called Eastern European. Currently, in the countries of the former Soviet Union, real German shepherds are mainly bred, but their fans have also remained in Eastern European countries. The main feature of this breed is a black back with silver-gray burns.
